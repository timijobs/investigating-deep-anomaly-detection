# Investigating the Efficiency of Deep Learning Models for Industrial Anomaly Detection
This repo contains the python notebooks detailing code experiments done for my MSc thesis titled, "Investigating the Efficiency of Deep Learning Models for Industrial Anomaly Detection".
In this project, I critically evaluated the literature, trained and evaluated 5 different state-of-the-art (S.O.T.A) deep learning models on the MVTecAD visual anomaly dataset. 

These models were evaluated for analysis using the standard pixel-AUROC metric alongside their inference latencies on CPU compute. The models include:
- CFLOW
- EfficientAD
- Patchcore
- PADIM
- STFPM

## Demo Application
You can find a demo web application I created based on this project using Gradio and hosted on HuggingFace Spaces [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/timijobs/Efficient_Deep_IAD).
